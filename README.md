# Robot Heron ðŸš¢
This repository provides a record of the development progress of Heron, and it is built upon the [repository](https://github.com/heron/heron_simulator) created by [@tonybaltovski
](https://github.com/tonybaltovski). 

Several Python codes have been developed that interact with the robot's topics, implementing a manual control mode of the boat as well as a path tracking model based on pure pursuit. 

First, you need to run the command 'roslaunch heron_gazebo heron_world.launch' to launch the boat with Gazebo and ROS.

Afterward, you have to execute 'control.py' to access manual and automatic control of the developed boat.
